- 👋 Hi, I’m @borchar
- 👀 I discovered performing arts at an early age and very early on, practiced computer science on my own. 
- The approach to art, video, light and the stage have never left me and I graduated for my light creations and video installations. 
- I have hired various collaborations with local structures (France Alsace). 
- I develop scripts for scenography related to music, light and the body in real time. 
- My encounters have led me to participate in various creations & residencies. 
- The intermittency will be marked by the desire to create interactive devices and surfaces which opens up unlimited perspectives with computer development...
- For 15 years, a specialization in digital communication: web page creation, visual identity, videos and mobile application development. 
- I create bespoke communication materials with an emphasis on design and design quality. Java software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scraping with Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web designer
